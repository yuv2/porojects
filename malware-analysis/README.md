# malware analysis

Malware analysis is the process of examining malicious software to understand its behavior, purpose, and potential impact on a system. The analysis can be done through by two options: static or dynamic analysis, which involves examining the code or executing the malware in a controlled environment. The goal of malware analysis is to identify the malware's functionality, potential risks, and ways to mitigate its impact. It is an important task in cybersecurity as it helps to detect, prevent, and respond to malware attacks. Common techniques used in malware analysis include signature-based detection, behavior-based detection, and sandbox analysis.


static analysis
Static analysis is a malware analysis technique that involves examining the code and structure of the malware without executing it. It can provide valuable information about the malware's behavior, including its file format, function calls, and dependencies. Static analysis is commonly used to quickly identify and classify malware, and it can be performed using a variety of tools witch ill provide in the next files

compare to static analysis in dynamic method we involve running a program and observing its behavior while it is executing. The goal of dynamic analysis is to identify defects or issues with the software by testing it with various inputs and test cases. Dynamic analysis can help identify bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.Dynamic analysis is typically more resource-intensive than other types of testing, and it is often used in conjunction with other types of testing, such as static analysis or manual testing, to ensure thorough testing of software



in the next files i added some scripts and tools that will help you stay safe from malwares including:

website_safety- a python script that checks if a website is safe to use and wont include malwares.


virus_total- a pyton script that checks if the file is malicious from the website virus total.

note: to use virus_total script you need to have an api key 
instructions : sign in in the website virus total to get an api key.

Autoruns: A utility tool that shows what programs are configured to run during system boot-up or login. It also provides detailed information about the registry entries or files that are used for auto-starting programs.

Process Monitor: A monitoring tool that displays real-time information about the file system, registry, and process activity on a system. It can help diagnose system issues, troubleshoot software conflicts, and track down malware infections.

FakeNet: A tool used for dynamic analysis of malware. It simulates a network environment in which the malware can be executed and monitored to determine its behavior and the network traffic it generates.

Pestudio: A tool used to analyze executable files and detect suspicious behaviors, including malware. It can detect packers, obfuscators, and other file anomalies that may indicate the presence of malware.

Regshot: A registry monitoring tool that takes snapshots of the system registry before and after an installation or system change. It can detect changes made to the registry, including those made by malware.


note:the password for the zip is: malware
note2: in the zip ("malware tools.zip) there is a malware that you can practice on ----- please open this malware in a vitual machine (sandbox) and use host only so the malware wont affect your system


the tools are mafe for malware analysis only.
